          How accurate is software used to predict future criminals?<br/><br/>And is it biased against certain groups?

        <div class="title">Risk Assessment Algorithms</div>
          In many states, judges, probation and parole officers use algorithms to consider how likely a criminal defendant will recidivate.<br><br>
          Northpointe Inc. created a popular commercial tool called COMPAS. <br><br>
          COMPAS assigns defendants several scores, such as <i>"Risk of Recidivism"</i> and <i>"Risk of Violent Recidivism."</i>

      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">Propublica Investigates</div>
        In 2016, journalists from ProPublica (a non-profit investigative journalist organization) gathered data on criminal defendants in Broward County, Florida. <br><br>They compared the risk scores predicted by COMPAS to what actually happened 2 years later.  
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">Pretrial Score</div>
Broward County mainly uses the score to determine whether to release or detain a defendant before his or her trial. <br><br>ProPublica discarded scores that were assessed at parole, probation or other stages in the criminal justice system. <br><br>This leaves 10,192 people who were assessed at the pretrial stage.     
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <div class="title"></div>
Of those defendants, 3,185 or 34% recidivated in 2 years.

      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">Distribution of Risk Scores</div>
          The overall distribution of COMPAS scores is right-skewed towards "low risk".  
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">Black Defendants Risk Scores</div>
        The overall distribution of COMPAS scores is left-skewed towards "high risk". 
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">White Defendants Risk Scores</div>
      The overall distribution of COMPAS scores is right-skewed towards "low risk". 
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">All Defendants Risk Scores</div>
         In contrast, Black defendants are twice as likely to be labelled "high risk".

          Depending on your skin color, your risk score may be different. For example: here is the distribution of risk scores for white defendants.
